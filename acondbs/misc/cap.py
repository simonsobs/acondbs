class cap_exec_rate:
    """cap the execution rate of a function

    This class prevents a function from being executed too often. This
    class executes a function in another thread. Once it executes a
    function, it starts a timer. If the function is called again
    through this class while the timer is still running, this class
    does not execute the function immediately. Instead, this class
    executes the function after the timer goes off.

    The function might be called multiple times through this class
    while the timer is running. After the timer goes off, this class
    only executes the function once.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        A function or any callable object to be executed not too often
    pause_time : float
        The length of time [second] to be waited after an execution of
        the `func` before the next execution. If the `func` is called
        through this class once or more times within this time length
        after an execution, it will be executed once after this time
        length passes.
    daemon : bool
        whether the thread which executes the function and sets the
        timer is daemonic. If `False`, the Python program doesn't exit
        until the thread ends; the method `end()` needs to be called;
        the function will be executed one last time if it has been
        called but not executed. If `True`, the thread can be abruptly
        stopped at the end of Python program; the function that has
        been called but not executed will not be executed.
